## What information Scout Machine collects and why
Information from your web browser that most websites collect such as IP for rough region, browser type, and operating 
system. We use this information to help us understand how people use our website, and to help us improve our website.
We rely upon Vercel's website analytics to collect this information.

### Information from users with accounts
We use Google sign-in & GitHub sign-in to authenticate users. Only the email address is stored in our database, your
password and personal information is stored on Google or GitHub's servers. We use the email address to identify users
and allow for users to request contact within in the marketplace for listings you may create, and to reach users in the 
event of an issue with their account or a security breach. We do not share your email address with outside parties.

## What information Scout Machine does not collect
We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as address of residency, health information, 
address of site access, & we do not save geolocation data users may choose to give in the events or marketplace search 
functions. The only information we collect is what you directly give to us, email address, username, team number. Users
under the age of 13 are not allowed to create accounts, and we do not knowingly collect information from users under the
age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian, and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
please contact us so that we will be able to take the necessary steps to wipe that information from our servers.

## How do we share the information we collect
We **do not** share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties for any purpose.

## Our use of cookies and tracking
